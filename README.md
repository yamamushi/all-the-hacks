# All The Hacks
Install Nethack variants and access Nethack servers through one easy utility

# Installation 

The following will download the ath utility, and run it from your current directory.

`curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yamamushi/all-the-hacks/master/ath.sh -o ath && chmod +x ath && ./ath`

Follow the prompts, and you'll be ready to go.

The ath script can be run from anywhere, and will install all the necessary dependencies.

In addition, for certain platforms and builds, a patch set is provided in this repository for building them successfully. OSX builds are more likely to require a patch.
